    "Python is a dynamically typed language where variable names are bound to different values, possibly of varying types, during program execution. The assignment operator simply creates an association between a name and a value. Although each value has an associated type such as an integer or string, variable names are untyped and can be made to refer to any type of data during execution. This is different from C, for example, in which a name represents a fixed type, size, and location in memory into which a value is stored. The dynamic behavior of Python can be seen in Listing 1.1 with the principal variable. Initially, it’s assigned to an integer value. However, later in the program it’s reassigned as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "principal = principal * (1 + rate) \n",
    "\n",
    "This statement evaluates the expression and reassociates the name principal with the result. Although the original value of principal was an integer 1000, the new value is now a floating-point number (rate is defined as a float, so the value of the above expression is also a float). Thus, the apparent “type” of principal dynamically changes from an integer to a float in the middle of the program. However, to be precise, it’s not the type of principal that has changed, but rather the value to which the principal name refers. A newline terminates each statement. However, you can use a semicolon to separate statements on the same line, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "principal = 1000; rate = 0.05; numyears = 5; \n",
    "\n",
    "The while statement tests the conditional expression that immediately follows. If the tested statement is true, the body of the while statement executes. The condition is then retested and the body executed again until the condition becomes false. Because the body of the loop is denoted by indentation, the three statements following while in Listing 1.1 execute on each iteration. Python doesn’t specify the amount of required indentation, as long as it’s consistent within a block. However, it is most common (and generally recommended) to use four spaces per indentation level. One problem with the program in Listing 1.1 is that the output isn’t very pretty. To make it better, you could right-align the columns and limit the precision of principal to two digits. There are several ways to achieve this formatting. The most widely used approach is to use the string formatting operator (%) like this: "

However, because each object contains a reference to the other, the reference count doesn’t drop to zero and the objects remain allocated (resulting in a memory leak). To address this problem, the interpreter periodically executes a cycle detector that searches for cycles of inaccessible objects and deletes them. The cycle-detection algorithm runs periodically as the interpreter allocates more and more memory during execution. The exact behavior can be fine-tuned and controlled using functions in the gc module (see Chapter 13, “Python Runtime Services”).\n"
